# SpeechLab Diarization Configuration
# ====================================
#
# This file configures the speaker diarization and voice-type classification pipeline.
#
# IMPORTANT: The Hugging Face token is NEVER stored in this file.
# Only the environment variable name is specified here.
# Set the actual token via: export HF_TOKEN=your_token_here
#

models:
  # Pyannote speaker diarization model
  # Uses version 3.1 which requires HF token with accepted license
  pyannote_pipeline: "pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1"

  # VTC 2.0 checkpoint path (optional)
  # Set to null to use default path inside container (/app/vtc_checkpoint)
  # Or specify a custom path to your VTC checkpoint
  vtc_checkpoint: null

huggingface:
  # Name of the environment variable containing the HF token
  # The actual token value is read from os.environ[token_env_var]
  # NEVER put the actual token in this file!
  token_env_var: "HF_TOKEN"

runtime:
  # Target sample rate for audio processing (Hz)
  # Both pyannote and VTC expect 16kHz audio
  sample_rate: 16000

  # Device for inference: "cuda" or "cpu"
  # Will automatically fall back to CPU if CUDA is not available
  device: "cuda"

  # Maximum audio duration in minutes (for sanity checks)
  # Files longer than this will trigger a warning
  max_duration_minutes: 60

io:
  # Input directory containing audio files (WAV, FLAC)
  # In Docker: mount your audio files to this path
  input_dir: "/data/input"

  # Output directory for RTTM and scores files
  # In Docker: mount a volume to this path to retrieve results
  output_dir: "/data/output"
